        <h1>My Dearest Zen,</h1>
        <p>
            Hi Love, i love you so much and i hope you have the best birthday ever! you deserve
            all the happiness in the world. Even though you don't like your birthday because itâ€™s common, for me itâ€™s
            the birthday of the most special person on earth.
            Thank you for being such an amazing person and for always being there for me. This is already my third time
            celebrating your birthday and just know iâ€™ve been thinking hard about what to get you since 47378229 years
            ago so you better appreciate it ðŸ˜¡.
            This year too i have to sadly write you a big paragraph about how much you mean to me but i really donâ€™t
            know how to start ðŸ˜¨... okayy i will start fr now!

            Hi Zen, this is already my third time celebrating your brithday. This year we again made lots of memories,
            from silly to emotional ones it was all special for me.
            I know iâ€™m hard to handle and iâ€™m grateful you put up with me so long.. This year marks a new beginning for
            you, not only are you now turning into an adult but youâ€™re also going to college.
            Honestly our relationship has been rocky these couple months and we have lots of arguments. I can not
            guarantee we stay together much longer but do know that if our relationship came to an end, i enjoyed it
            fully ðŸ’—!.

            College is gonna take a lot of your time and i will only drain your energy so yeah.
            Even so these arguments helped us overcome a lot of our problems and they helped me understand you better.
            In this letter i wanna tell you how i feel about you and what i think about our relationship.

            Zen, youâ€™re my bestfriend and honestly i donâ€™t say it a lot but i appreciate you so much as a friend.
            Youâ€™re always there for me when i need you and you always listen to me when i rant about my problems.
            I know iâ€™ve been distant these past few months and iâ€™m sorry for that.
            calling you google like everyone else does feel wrong and i didnâ€™t want to lose that special connection we
            had.

            Sometimes i miss the times where it was just the two of us talking for hours about anything and everything,
            or hanging out and do nothing but at least it was just the two of us.
            I feel like we canâ€™t be ourselves around each other anymore sometimes.

            but itâ€™s okay, i understand that weâ€™re both busy and we canâ€™t always be together.
            I just want you to know that no matter what happens i will always be here for you as a friend.
            The older we get the more inevatable it is that we will grow apart but i hope that we can stay friends no
            matter what.

            Compared to the silly memories we used to make, this year we made more serious ones and tho it isnâ€™t always
            rainbow and sunshine it shows we are maturing and trying to figure life out.
            Meeting you was a surpisingly good thing that happened to me. I never thought i would find someone like you
            who understands me and accepts me for who i am (tho you judge me 24/7..!).
            youâ€™re not perfect and neither am i but we complement each other in a way that makes us better together.
            i know iâ€™m not the easiest person to be with and iâ€™m sorry for that. But you make me happy and i hope i make
            you happy too.
            I know you have a lot of insecurities and i want you to know that i love you for who you are and not for
            what you look like or what you have.
            Youâ€™re always saying your not good enough for me but thatâ€™s not true. Youâ€™re more than enough for me and iâ€™m
            grateful to have you in my life.
            Didnâ€™t you say we are the same?
            So if youâ€™re not good enough for me then iâ€™m not good enough for you either lolz.

            I want to tell you what i love about you.
            I love your kindness, youâ€™re always so caring and you always put others before yourself.
            Which i also hate because you treat me like a sidehoe sometimes. I love your patience, you never get mad at
            me even when iâ€™m being really annoying. I love your personality, youâ€™re so funny and you always make me
            laugh.
            I might not always get the jokes you make or the dumb refrences you do but i love how you try to make me
            laugh.
            i love your understanding, you always try to see things from my perspective and you never judge me when iâ€™m
            serious.
            i love how we can joke during serious moments and be serious during jokes. This means no matter what, we can
            always
            be ourselves around each other. You seriously are my counterpart and i hate how similar we are sometimes.
            I love how we can talk about anything and everything.
            I love how we can be ourselves around each other and not have to pretend to be someone else. At least i
            donâ€™t have to pretend. Idk about you.
            I love how you always reply to all my memes & my hok stats even tho you donâ€™t give a shit at all but pretend
            you do.
            i hope that we can continue to be together and make more memories.
            By the time for your next birthday i hope we are still together and that we can celebrate it again.
            I also hope that you will be more open and honest with your feelings about me and our relationship.
            You're my bestfriend and my lover and i hope that we can continue to be together for a long time.
            May you have a good birthday!!.

            i will always be here for you no matter what (unless you break up with me then iâ€™m not responsible for my
            actions lolz).

            happy birthday again, my love! ðŸ’™ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚

    hi, i love you so much and i hope you have the best birthday ever! you deserve
    all the happiness in the world. Even though you don't like your birthday because itâ€™s common for me itâ€™s the
    birthday of the most special person on earth.
    Thank you for being such an amazing person and for always being there for me. This is already my third time
    celebrating your birthday and just know iâ€™ve been thinking hard about what to get you since 47378229 years ago so
    you better appreciate it ðŸ˜¡.
    This year too i have to sadly write you a big paragraph about how much you mean to me but i really donâ€™t know how to
    start ðŸ˜¨... okayy i will start fr now!

    Hi Zen, this is already my third time celebrating your brithday. This year we again made lots of memories, from
    silly to emotional ones it was all special for me.
    I know iâ€™m hard to handle and iâ€™m grateful you put up with me so long.. This year marks a new beginning for you,
    not only are you now in the 2 digits but youâ€™re also going to college.
    Honestly our relationship has been rocky these couple months and we have lots of arguments. I can not guarantee we
    stay together much longer but do know that if our relationship came to an end i enjoyed it fully ðŸ’—!.
    College is gonna take a lot of your time and i will only drain your energy so yeah.
    Even so these arguments helped us overcome a lot of our problems and they helped me understand you better.
    In this letter i wanna tell you how i feel about you and what i think about our relationship.

    Zen, youâ€™re my bestfriend and honestly i donâ€™t say it a lot but i appreciate you so much as a friend.
    Youâ€™re always there for me when i need you and you always listen to me when i rant about my problems.
    I know iâ€™ve been distant these past few months and iâ€™m sorry for that.
    In fact i donâ€™t even remember when i stopped calling you zen continuesly but i think it was around the time we
    started arguing a lot.
    calling you google like everyone else does feel wrong and i didnâ€™t want to lose that special connection we had.
    I miss the times when we would just talk for hours about anything and everything.
    I miss the times when we would just hang out and do nothing just the two of us.
    I miss the times when we would just be ourselves around each other and not have to pretend to be someone else.
    but itâ€™s okay, i understand that weâ€™re both busy and we canâ€™t always be together.
    I just want you to know that no matter what happens i will always be here for you as a friend and maybe more if you
    want to.
    The older we get the more inevatable it is that we will grow apart but i hope that we can stay friends no matter
    what.
    I know you donâ€™t like to show off our relationship and you prefer to keep it a secret but sometimes it hurts me.
    But as i said before i understand that youâ€™re busy and you have other priorities. And as your bestfriend i want you
    to be happy no matter what.
    I respect your wishes and i will always be here for you no matter what (unless you break up with me then iâ€™m not
    responsible for my actions lolz).

    Compared to the silly memories we used to make this year we made more serious ones and tho it isnâ€™t always rainbow
    and sunshine it shows we are maturing and trying to figure life out.
    Meeting you was a surpisingly good thing that happened to me. I never thought i would find someone like you who
    understands me and accepts me for who i am.
    youâ€™re not perfect and neither am i but we complement each other in a way that makes us better together.
    i know iâ€™m not the easiest person to be with and iâ€™m sorry for that. But you make me happy and i hope i make you happy too.
    I know you have a lot of insecurities and i want you to know that i love you for who you are and not for what you look like or what you have.
    Youâ€™re always saying your not good enough for me but thatâ€™s not true. Youâ€™re more than enough for me and iâ€™m grateful to have you in my life. 
    Didnâ€™t you say we were the same? 
    So if youâ€™re not good enough for me then iâ€™m not good enough for you either lolz.

    I have told you before that i keep our relationship a secret.. itâ€™s not because iâ€™m ashamed of you or anything
    in fact itâ€™s the opposite. In my past relationship i always felt like i was being judged by others and i hated
    that. I wanted to be with you for me and not for what others think of you. I wanted to be with you because i love
    you and not because i wanted to show off. I wanted to be with you because you made me happy.
    I wanted that if there was a problem between us we would solve it ourselves and not have others interfere.
    I loved our relationship being between us and not having to worry about what others think but recently iâ€™ve been
    frustrated about it
    because i want to show you off. I want to tell the world that iâ€™m with you and that i love you.
    I donâ€™t want others to think youâ€™re single and that youâ€™re available.
    we have been together for almost 3 years and i promised i would wait for you but your friends make me doubt
    everything.

    Please donâ€™t think i will force you into a relationship you donâ€™t want, i mean iâ€™ve waited for 3 years lolz.
    if you did the quiz you would know what i hate most about you. The more i try to communicate with you the more i
    realize
    how bad your communication skills are. I know youâ€™re not good at expressing your feelings but please try to
    understand mine. Also message me first, and no good mornings or goodnights, actual conversations. unless you want to
    break up with me then i understand. You twat.


    aside from all that negativity i want to tell you what i love about you.
    I love your kindness, youâ€™re always so caring and you always put others before yourself.
    Which i also hate because you treat me like a sidehoe sometimes. I love your patience, you never get mad at me
    even when iâ€™m being really annoying. I love your personality, youâ€™re so funny and you always make me laugh.
    I might not always get the jokes you make or the dumb refrences you do but i love how you try to make me laugh.
    i love your understanding, you always try to see things from my perspective and you never judge me when iâ€™m serious.
    i love how we can joke during serious moments and be serious during jokes. this means no matter what we can always
    be ourselves around each other. you seriously are my counterpart and i hate how similar we are sometimes.
    I love how we can talk about anything and everything.
    I love how we can be ourselves around each other and not have to pretend to be someone else. at least i donâ€™t have
    to pretend idk about you.
    I love how you always reply to all my memes & my hok stats even tho you donâ€™t give a shit at all but pretend you do.
    i hope that we can continue to be together and make more memories.
    By the time for your next birthday i hope we are still together and that we can celebrate it again.
    I also hope that you will be more open and honest with your feelings about me and our relationship.
    You're my bestfriend and my lover and i hope that we can continue to be together for a long time.
    May you have a good birthday!!.

    happy birthday again, my love! ðŸ’™ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
